# Ames Housing Price Predictor

A machine learning web application that predicts residential property sale prices using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. Built with Streamlit for an interactive browser-based interface with no coding required to use.

Developed as part of an applied AI and Python toolkit demonstrating machine learning integration in real-world prediction problems.

## What It Does

The app takes key property characteristics as inputs and returns an estimated sale price in dollars. It offers two model options — an essential features model for quick estimates using only five key inputs, and a full features model that incorporates the complete dataset feature set for a more comprehensive prediction.

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ames-housing-predictor.git
cd ames-housing-predictor
```

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the app:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Models

The app offers two prediction models selectable from the sidebar:

### Essential Features Model
Uses five key property characteristics to generate a fast, interpretable estimate. Best for quick comparisons or when full property data is unavailable.

### All Features Model
Uses the complete Ames dataset feature set with user-provided essential inputs and dataset-derived defaults for remaining features. Generally produces a more precise estimate by accounting for a broader range of property characteristics.

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Age | Years since construction (Year Sold minus Year Built) | 0 – 200 |
| Ground Living Area | Above-grade finished living area in square feet | 300 – 10,000 |
| Lot Area | Total lot size in square feet | 500 – 50,000 |
| Overall Quality | Overall material and finish quality rating | 1 – 10 |
| Neighborhood | Property neighborhood within Ames, Iowa | Dropdown |

---

## Output

The model returns a **predicted sale price in dollars** based on the provided inputs.

> **Important:** Predictions are estimates generated by a neural network trained on historical Ames, Iowa housing data. Results should not be used for appraisal, lending, or real estate transaction decisions. Always consult a licensed appraiser or real estate professional for official property valuations.

## Required Files

The following files must be present in the project directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app.py` | Main Streamlit application |
| `model_selected.h5` | Trained ANN model using essential features only |
| `model_all.h5` | Trained ANN model using all dataset features |
| `preprocessor_selected.pkl` | Preprocessing pipeline for essential features model |
| `preprocessor_all.pkl` | Preprocessing pipeline for all features model |
| `default_all_features.csv` | Default feature values for the all features model |

---

## How the Model Works

The prediction pipeline runs in two stages:

**1. Preprocessing**
User inputs are passed through a scikit-learn preprocessing pipeline that handles numeric feature scaling and one-hot encoding of the categorical `Neighborhood` field. This ensures inputs match the format and scale the models were trained on.

**2. ANN Inference**
The preprocessed inputs are fed into a TensorFlow/Keras Artificial Neural Network trained to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) on historical Ames housing sale prices. The all features model supplements user inputs with dataset-derived defaults for non-essential features before preprocessing and inference.

## About the Dataset

The [Ames Housing Dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) was compiled by Dean De Cock and contains 2,930 residential property sales in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. It includes 79 explanatory variables covering nearly every aspect of residential properties and is widely used as a benchmark dataset for regression modeling.

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `streamlit` | Interactive web app interface |
| `tensorflow` | ANN model loading and inference |
| `pandas` | Input data formatting |
| `joblib` | Preprocessing pipeline serialization |
| `scikit-learn` | Preprocessing pipeline |

Install all at once:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Context

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning regression to real estate valuation — a domain where accurate price prediction has direct practical value for buyers, sellers, and assessors. It was built to showcase end-to-end machine learning workflow skills including data preprocessing, model training, and interactive deployment as part of a professional civil and data engineering portfolio.

The dual-model architecture illustrates a practical trade-off common in applied ML: a simpler, more interpretable model versus a more complex model with greater predictive accuracy.

## Disclaimer

This tool provides estimated property values based on a neural network trained on historical Ames, Iowa housing data from 2006–2010. Predictions may not reflect current market conditions, regional price variations, or property-specific factors not captured in the input features. This tool is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
